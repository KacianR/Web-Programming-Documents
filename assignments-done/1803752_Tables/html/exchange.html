                            Develop an open mind. At the beginning of a cultural exchange
                            experience, approach new situations with curiosity. Ask lots of
                            questions and consider the way culture may shape your
                            interactions. Most important, don't shy away from new
                            experiences with people who may think differently from you; it will
                            help you develop empathy and cross-cultural skills
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Become more independent. Moving to a new country to teach is a
                            big step for your independence and will help you grow self-confidence and a sense of
                            accomplishment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Appreciate new perspectives and ways of living. You will learn so
                            much from your new colleagues and neighbors, from what they do
                            on the weekends to what motivates them in their work. Walk in
                            their shoes and alongside them on this journey as much as you
                            can.

                            country! Use your cultural exchange as an opportunity to be a
                            cultural ambassador and share your expertise with those around
                            you.
